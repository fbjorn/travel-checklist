        I take your privacy very seriously. This application doesn't collect any
        data that you input during creation of your checklists. I use
        self-hosted analytics service called
        <a href="https://matomo.org" target="_blank">Matomo</a>, which is
        privacy-focused and
        <strong>doesn't collect any cookies or personal information</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        I gather some analytics from this website, but only about page visits
        and popularity of different export methods. This helps me with the
        development of this service.
